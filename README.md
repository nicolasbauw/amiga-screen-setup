# Amiga hardware - basic copperlist setup

In this repo, a very old (assembly) source I wrote when I was learning Amiga hardware, that was my first working setup / system restore code, and copperlist setup.
In 2020 I added the C version.

The C version is not *too* fat : 1868 bytes (368 bytes for the assembly version).

Works on 68K / ECS. May NOT work on other machines.
